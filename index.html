							<h3>About Me</h3>
							<p>Hello, my name is Andrew Bousfield. My journey in development began over 10 years ago in 2013. After exploring other facets of life, I made the decision to pursue a full-time career in development. In 2023, I achieved a frontend development certification from Meta, which is a significant milestone in my journey. I'm excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead in this dynamic field as a developer.</p>

							<h3>My First Project</h3>
							<p> In 2013, I initiated a fundraiser for the Chicago Park 4H Club, which involved writing a grant to secure seed funding. I collaborated with members of Xcel Agency to develop a website for our fundraising initiative called "Resolve 2 Run." Working closely with the Xcel Agency team, I received invaluable support throughout the website-building process, resulting in a highly successful platform for our event. <a href="https://resolve2run.com">resolve2run.com</a>
